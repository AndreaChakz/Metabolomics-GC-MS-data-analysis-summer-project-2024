Data analysis of netCDF files from GC-EI-MS data of L cell lines stimulated with low and high glucose concentrations. 
XCMS, RAMClustR, matchms, and MetaboAnalystR was used to identify metabolites and metabolic pathways that were statistically significant. 
Our data lacked some column expected by XCMS so the first code we used was "add variables to netCDF files" 
We then computed the retention index with the alkane series 
Next is preprocessing the data files with the code called "preprocessing" - this uses XCMS for peak picking, RAMClustR for deconvolution and partial annotation. After this we exported the .msp file generated in order to use matchms 
Matchms is run in Spyder and uses the file created by the R code. It identifies all compounds and writes a CSV file called "names" with the names of the compounds. We then manually copied the row of names into the SpecAbund CSV (Excel) file created by the "preprocessing code". The SpecAbund file is what MetaboAnalystR uses in the "statistical analysis" code to identify statistically significant compounds. When these have been found, a CSV file is generated called "t-test" that contains all the statistically significant compounds. We then write all the statistically significant compounds into a vector in the "pathway enrichment" code in order for MetaboAnalystR to find which pathways are significantly enriched.
